# CS334 Final Project

Panko (Paint n Kode) is a drawing language but with a painting twist. Panko allows users to create paintings from individual brush strokes, which are customized by the users. Unlike a drawing language which is more focused on constructing shapes from lines (for example, Logo), Panko aims to create paintings from brush strokes. 
    
I think Panko would be a nice addition to the existing drawing programming languages because it aims to create more organic/ painterly paintings. With Panko (and some patience) we can create impressionistic paintings (say, Monet!) using smaller brush strokes of all different colors.

Three example Panko programs are included: Primary.pk, HelloPanko.pk, and FlowerField.pk.
